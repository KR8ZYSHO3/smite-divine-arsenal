    "Support": {"physical_protection": 4.5, "magical_protection": 4.5, "health": 4.0},
    # ... other roles
}

# Counter-building intelligence
enhanced_counters = {
    "healing_comp": {"items": ["Divine Ruin", "Brawler's Beat Stick", "Contagion"]},
    "heavy_physical": {"items": ["Sovereignty", "Midgardian Mail", "Witchblade"]},
    # ... other compositions
}
```

**TOS Compliance Features:**
```python
class TrackerRealtimeCollector:
    def _respect_rate_limit(self):
        # Ensures TOS compliance
        if self.request_count >= self.rate_limit:
            time.sleep(backoff_time)
    
    def _make_api_request(self, endpoint: str):
        # API-driven only, no screen scraping
        response = self.session.get(url, timeout=10)
```

### ✅ **Counter-Building Intelligence** - COMPLETED
**Your Recommendation:** "Enhanced counter-building with meta awareness"

**Implementation:**
- **80% Anti-Heal Meta:** Priority counter for healing compositions
- **Role-Appropriate Counters:** Filters items by role constraints
- **Situational Items:** Playstyle-based recommendations
- **Meta Compliance:** Current patch (OB9) awareness

**Counter System:**
```python
def _generate_counter_items(self, enemy_comp: EnemyComposition, role: str):
    # Anti-healing (80% reduction meta)
    if enemy_comp.composition_type == "healing_comp":
        return ["Divine Ruin", "Brawler's Beat Stick", "Contagion"]
    
    # Role-appropriate filtering
    avoid_categories = role_priorities.get(role, {}).get("avoid_categories", [])
```
